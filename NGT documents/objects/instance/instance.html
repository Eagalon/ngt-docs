<p>instance object</p><br>
<p>The instance object is used to check whether a given program is already running.</p>
<h1>instance(string application_name)</h1>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>variable</th><th>description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>application_name</td>
<td>An optional unique name that is used internally for the program.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>This object is useful if you wish to prevent multiple instances of the same program from being opened at the same time.</p>
<p>If the application_name argument is specified, it should not be more than 100 characters in length. If it is not specified, it will default to a hash of the program executable and hence will not work if trying to prevent an older version of a program from running alongside an updated copy.</p>
<p>This class does not have many functions, as this is simple.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
/*
Write a script that checks for another instance of itself. To make this script work effectively you must run it at least twice within twenty seconds of the first instance being started.
*/

void main()
{
instance myapp("instancetester");
if(myapp.is_running())
{
alert("Error", "This script is already running, hence, failed to execute!");
quit();
}
wait(20000);
}
