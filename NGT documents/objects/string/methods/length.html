<p>string object</p><br>
<p>This method returns the length of the string.</p>
<h1>uint length()</h1>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>None</p>
<h2>Return Value</h2>
<p>The length of the string, or 0 if the string is empty or if an error occurs.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Please note that the value returned is the length of the string rather than the index of the last character in the string. Therefore, when using the length method as a basis for a loop, it is important to check that any counting variable accessing individual characters in the string stops when the counter reaches the length mark, not beyond it. This is because the index is 0 based. In other words, with a string containing 3 entries, you may access elements 0, 1, and 2.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
<pre>
// Declare a string and display its characters.
void main()
{
string hello;
hello = "Hello";
alert("String", "The string " + hello + " contains " + hello.length() + " characters.");
for (int counter = 0; counter < hello.length(); counter++)
{
alert("String", "Character " + counter + " is " + hello[counter] + ".");
}
}
</pre>
