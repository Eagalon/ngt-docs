<p>get_sound_storage</p><br>
<p>This function gets the location of the path in which the engine will look for sound files loaded through the sound object.<br></p>
<h1>string get_sound_storage()</h1>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2>Return value</h2>
<p>The path on success, or an empty string on failure.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Note that both \ and / can be used to specify paths.</p>
<p>If an empty string is returned by this function, it means that the engine will not look for sounds in a specified path, but will attempt to locate requested files on disk instead. This is the default behavior.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
<pre>
// Tell the engine to look for sound files in a folder called sounds, and then print this.
void main()
{
set_sound_storage("sounds");
alert("Sound storage", "The sound storage is " + get_sound_storage() + ".");
}
</pre>
