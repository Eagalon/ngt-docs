<p>set_sound_storage</p><br>
<p>This function sets the location of the path in which the engine will look for sound files loaded through the sound object.<br></p>
<h1>void set_sound_storage(string path)</h1>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>variable</th><th>description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>path</td>
<td>The path to use. This can be either an absolute path or a relative path.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Return value</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Note that both \ and / can be used to specify paths.</p>
<p>If an empty string is passed to this function, the engine will not look for sounds in a pack file but will attempt to locate requested files on disk instead. This is the default behavior.</p>
<p>It is perfectly legal to call this function more than once in your game. Sounds that are already loaded will not be affected; any changes are only seen the next time you attempt to load a sound.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
<pre>
// Tell the engine to look for sound files in a folder called sounds.
void main()
{
set_sound_storage("sounds");
}
</pre>
