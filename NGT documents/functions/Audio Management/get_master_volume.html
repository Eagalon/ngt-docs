<p>get_master_volume</p><br>
<p>This function gets the master volume for the sound mixer.<br></p>
<h1>float get_master_volume()</h1>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2>Return value</h2>
<p>The master volume between 1 and 0. Default is 1.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The master volume works similar to the master fader on a mixing desk. It controls every sound that is played during the game and works independently of a sound object's volume control. This means that you can continue treating the volume of individual sound objects exactly the same as before, where 1 is always the maximum based on the current master volume. This can be useful if your game uses quiet TTS output and has a rather loud or busy soundscape.</p>
<p>Please note that these functions do not apply to the Windows volume control, only sounds that are played from within the game itself.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
<pre>
// Set the master volume to 0.35 and retrieve the new value.
void main()
{
set_master_volume(0.35);
alert("Sound master volume", "The sound master volume is " + get_master_volume() + ".");
}
</pre>
